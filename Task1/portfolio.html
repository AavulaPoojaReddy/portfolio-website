        <h2> About Me</h2>
        <hr>
        <p> Hi, I'm AAVULA POOJA REDDY, a passionate engineering student specializing in cybersecurity and software development. I am currently pursuing a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science at Malla Reddy Engineering College For Women.
            My technical skill set includes proficiency in programming languages like Python, Java, and SQL, as well as experience with web development. I also have a strong foundation in data structures, algorithms, and cybersecurity principles.
            
            I have completed internships at Next24Tech Company where I worked on developing secure web applications and implementing machine learning models for predictive analytics. Additionally, I participated in the national level hackathon in geetanjali engineeri ng college, where my team developed a cybersecurity solution.
            
            One of my notable projects is the development of a logo forgery application that detects the fake logos or the images. I utilized React for the front end, Flask for the back end, and MongoDB for data storage. This project helped me enhance my full-stack development skills and gain practical experience with API integration.
            
            I am particularly interested in the fields of cybersecurity and artificial intelligence, with a goal to develop innovative solutions that enhance digital security. I aspire to work on projects that leverage AI for cybersecurity and contribute to creating secure, self-healing systems.
            
            Outside of my academic and professional pursuits, I enjoy participating in hackathons, solving puzzles, and staying updated with the latest tech trends. I am also an avid runner and enjoy exploring new trails during my free time.

                  <h2>Disc Space Rental System</h2> 
                  <p> 
                   The Disc Space Rental System is incredibly important because it tackles the challenge of managing
                   and allocating disk space effectively.By implementing this system, organizations can offer disk Space
                   foe rent to users based on their specific needs.This means that users can access the required amount
                   of disk space without having to invest in purchasing their own hardware.

                  <p> 
                     The goal is to develop a system that can identify and detect forged or manipulated logos.This is 
                     important because logo forgery can lead to fraudulent activities, such as counterfeit products
                     or misleading advertisements.To detect logo forgery, various techniques can be used, such as image 
                     analysis, machine learning, and computer vision.

                  <h2>Web Vulnerability</h2> 
                  <p> 
                     Web vulnerabilities, such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and cross-site request forgery (CSRF),
                     pose significant threats to the security of web applications and their users.This provides an overview 
                     of common web vulnerabilities, their impact, and current approaches for mitigating them and also the 
                     importance of secure coding practices, regular security audits, and the use of security tools and frameworks
                    to protect web applications from potential attacks. Additionally, we explore emerging trends and technologies,
                    such as machine learning and artificial intelligence, that show promise in improving web application security.
